Text: 

So you want to get a website for your business so your customers can reach you online but you have no idea where to start?

You simply don’t have the time to sit down and figure out exactly what features your need, what backend/CMS to use, figure out all the jargon, etc.

Even being ambitious enough to try a DIY website builder leads you frustrated.

**Your website should work for your business as much as you do.**

Stop right there.

Take a deep breath. You’ve been frustrated enough.

Working with business owners like you and coming across this same problem over and over again, I’ve created a solution just for you.

##Roadmapping is Consultation Offer Just For You
Roadmapping Sessions are a series of consultations that guide you form A-Z in kicking off a web design project. A solid majority of my clients opt to schedule it before having me design or redesign their website.

**Figure out a step-by-step plan of action** that will effortlessly solve your business problem through the website your business deserves.

**Narrow down an estimate of budget and timeframe your project will take.**

##Every Session Includes:

**3-4 Interactions** over phone calls or Skype that uncover the root-level pains and problems of your business so we can determine possible solutions for them.

**A Custom, jargon-free Proposal** presented with three different budget levels that allow you to pick the amount of investment you’re most comfortable with. You reserve the right to use this proposal to shop around for other designers & developers.

### All at an Affordable Rate
No more hesitating about kicking off your website project; **Roadmapping Sessions are a one-time fee of only $475.** This is something that can save you thousands of dollars in project mistakes, so it's an investment worth making.
