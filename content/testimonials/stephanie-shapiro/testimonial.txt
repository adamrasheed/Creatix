"Adam sat down with us and helped us define the business goals we could achieve when we were looking into getting our Chamber website redesigned to appeal to the new wave of business owners in Corona.

This road-mapping session definitely helped us lay down a clear path to follow when continuing forward with our website redesign. During our hour-long meeting, **he helped us get answers for questions we hadn’t even thought of, **like how we could use our website to drive membership signups and increase attendance to our events, which all could increase the revenue of our organization. In addition, **he gave us specifics on exactly how he would get this project done** (technologies being used, timelines, etc.) so we could turn around and ask other designers in the area if we so chose.
