I recently redesigned this website. Right now, you’re reading this on a blog that wasn’t there before, in a 

## The Problems with my Old Website
While my site was well-designed and I got compliments on it, there were a few problems with it.

### Old site wasn’t bringing me Clients

### Difficult to make updates
My old site was static site. Had to ftp everything. No way to dynamically change content. I had been creating custom CMS-based websites for my clients yet I didn’t have one.

### It wasn’t developed Correctly
It worked fine for a one-page site, but this new site was going be much larger in scale and included, multiple case studies, blog articless a resource page, and much more. For something this size, I needed to have organized, scalable code.

## It Didn't Meet My Business goals
Like all of the websites I create for my clients, this site is meant to be more than a pretty-looking page. It’s designed from the ground up to deliver results. It’s supposed to be a tool that allows me to display my work and show my prospective clients how I can benefit them.

### I need to Educate my clients

### Provide a hub of my marketing efforts

### Be a dependable Source of high-quality information

### Showcase my client work
Notice how this isn’t the most important thing I want to display on my site.

## The Design
I aimed to have solid, clean design that didn’t distract from the content.

### Sketched it out
Pencil and Paper. This process if perhaps the most important because it throws things like colors, fonts, and other visual details out the window and focuses on what matters most: content and layout. Content is WHY your visitors go to your site and layout helps organize that content.

### UI Design
Once I have a wireframes laid in place, I focus on the actual design. This involved deciding on a color scheme, fonts sizes, and the types of details I’d be using.I used a program called sketch, which I’m quite well-versed at.
### Photography
Since I also do professional photography, I had no choice to have a full-blown shoot for this project.

## The Development
### CMS 
I wanted at allow something
### Kirby
While I normally work in Wordpress, I wanted to use Kirby for a few reasons.


## Conclusion
I’ll always love my original website, but I’m really happy with the result. I treated this like a client-project.
