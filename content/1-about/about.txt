#### No Hourly Billing

Have a question? Ask away, it won’t show up on your invoice. Promise. I have flat-rate fees specific to every project, and for the duration of  your project, you’re welcome to email and call whenever during office hours. 

#### Your Business Goals are Priority Numero Uno

You get more than a just pretty-looking website. Your new project will be a full-fledged hub of all your online marketing efforts, while will bring your customers to your site. It’s the sites job to turn those visitors into paying customers and clients.

#### No Corporate Jargon. Just One Incredibly Handsome guy in a Home Office.

There’s no bureaucracy, no Mad-Men-esque steak dinners and cocktails billed at your expense. I provide a professional service from my home office in Corona, CA. Most of my clients aren’t actually even in my state. I just wrapped a project for a client Arkansas, all while in the comfort of my home. I have an incredible client web design process that let’s me take up to three clients at any time, and if I’m full I’ll happily schedule to work on your project up next. 

Weekly Check-ins to Make Sure Your Project is a Success.

Instead of going MIA, I’ll make sure, to the point of annoyance, to check in with you every week to update you on my progress, make sure we’re all on track with everything, and make sure that we’re handling any bumps along the way.

Testimonial: 

Adam was instrumental in taking my business to the next level. He developed an amazing website and took care of all the details.

I was really impressed with the quality of the photos, as well as the video he produced. I proudly pass Adam's information along, knowing I can vouch for his work without hesitation. The best part about Adam's style is his flexibility.

My schedule is really crazy and unpredictable, yet Adam found a way to work around my schedule. He is professional, caring, and pays close attention to detail. Not to mention, he would get a hold of me whenever he had a question. He was very accessible and communicated everything he did.
